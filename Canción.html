      <p>Faster than a bullet
         Terrifying scream
         Enraged and full of anger
         He is half man and half machine
         Rides the metal monster
         Breathing smoke and fire
         Closing in with vengeance soaring high
           
        </p>
      <p>
            He is the painkiller
            This is the painkiller
        </p>
      <p>
            Planets devastated
Mankind's on its knees
A savior comes from out the skies
In answer to their pleas
Through boiling clouds if thunder
Blasting bolts of steel
Evils going under deadly wheels
        </p>
      <p>
           He is the painkiller
This is the painkiller
        </p>
      <p>
            Faster then a laser bullet
Louder than an atom bomb
Chromium plated boiling metal
Brighter than a thousand suns
        </p>
      <p>
          Flying high on rapture
Stronger free and brave
Nevermore encaptured
They've been brought back from the grave
With mankind resurrected
Forever to survive
Returns from Armageddon to the skies
        </p>
      <p>
            He is the painkiller
This is the painkiller
Wings of steel painkiller
Deadly wheels painkiller
        </p>
      <p>
           He is the painkiller
This is the painkiller
He is the painkiller
This is the painkiller
        </p>
      <p>
          Pain! Pain! Killer! Killer!
Pain! Pain! Killer! Killer!
        </p>
      <p>
           Can't stop the painkiller
Pain
        </p>
